This was my final project for my Computer Simulations of Complex Physical Systems class. I chose to model ant 
colony activity to help understand how simple creatures, ants, are able to create complex colonies that thrive and 
adapt surprisingly well considering the intelligence of ants. 

The notebook in this repo has a lot of text describing the project and how I set up the ant colony rules. All of
the actual code is located in the appendices of the notebook.

The code for this project was largely adapted from the work in "Modeling Nature: Cellular Automata Simulations with 
Mathematica" written by Richard J. Gaylord and Kazume Nishidate. Their code really provided the background for my
simulation!
